Parasitic capacitance modeling for process metal stackups using FasterCap
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier work:

For all initial investigations, see the subdirectory "preliminary".

From 10/3/2022:

See file README.orig, containing results mostly from 12/20/2022
to 12/24/2022, involving a lot of useful development but with
incorrect results.  All following text has been updated and
results corrected, starting from 12/26/2022.

The current directory is for the complete analysis and modeling.
A python script generates many FasterCap input files, runs
FasterCap on them, parses the output for the matrix values,
and generates files of SPICE parameter tables of the sort used
by SkyWater.

Then another python script reads the SPICE parameter tables and
generates coefficients for use with magic by curve-fitting.
The first such script will be used to determine how far off the
equations being curve-fit are, so that it can be determined if
the models in magic need to be extended to accurately model the
parasitics (likely conclusion:  yes).

Since analysis will most likely lead to different modeling in
magic, final generation of parasitics for the magic tech file
will be the last part done.

Run scripts:
-----------------
build_fc_files_w2.py	Updated (Nov. 26) --- for 2 wire setup
build_fc_files_w1.py	for 1 wire setup
build_fc_files_w1sh.py	for 1 wire with shield setup
build_fc_files_w1n.py	for 1 wire coupling to metal above setup
(All four scripts corrected for syntax 12/26/2022)

Run-time data:
-----------------
metal_stack_sky130A.py	See file comments for description.

By the version 2 script, I settled on a consistent metal stack
description.  When this was last left off on Nov. 28 (2022),
the script runs fastercap (reliably) and produces file
"w2_results.txt", but results have not been run through analysis.

w2_results.txt file columns are:
(1) wire layer
(2) substrate type
(3) wire width
(4) wire spacing
(5) capacitance from one wire to substrate
(6) capacitance between wires

Now need to figure out what geometric setup and analysis are
required to separate out the information needed.

Picking work back up on Dec. 20 (2022). . .

-------------------------------------------------------------
1) Get parallel plate capacitance for each layer from existing
   tables.  This much is known and agreed upon (well, at least
   within a fairly small error delta).  This is done without
   Fastercap, but only with direct calculation of (eps0 * K / d).

2) Run same tests with a single wire, obtaining a single result
   for wire to substrate capacitance (for all substrate types,
   and at different wire widths).  Subtract off parallel plate
   capacitance from (1) to obtain maximum fringe capacitance
   without shielding.  Divide in half to get the fringe cap per
   side.

	w1_results.txt file columns are:
	(1) wire layer
	(2) substrate type
	(3) wire width
	(4) capacitance from wire to substrate

3) Existing 2-wire data then yields the effect of substrate
   shielding of the fringe capacitance (max fringe from (2)
   minus result for shielded wire to substrate).  Take these
   results and use to refine the fringe shielding model in
   magic.

4) Coupling data can be used as-is and modeled to get the two
   coefficients to plug into magic.  Max fringe per side also
   goes into magic's coefficients.

5) Now for each single-wire model, add a shielding plane
   underneath, growing from the simulation edge until the
   plane extends edge to edge and blocks everything.  That
   should result in cap-to-substrate and cap-to-shield values
   that can be used to model the partial shielding to
   substrate and the layer-to-layer capacitance, and determining
   whether a more accurate accounting of the halo distance is
   needed.

	w1sh_results.txt file columns are:
	(1) wire layer
	(2) substrate type
	(3) wire width
	(4) spacing from wire center to shield edge
	(5) capacitance from wire to substrate
	(6) capacitance between wire and shield

6) Do a wire-over-wire test, with a wire underneath of fixed
   width (instead of a shield), passing from left edge to right
   edge.  Do this for several wire widths.  Use to check against
   magic's model of partial fringe assignment.

	w1shw_results.txt file columns are:
	(1) wire layer
	(2) substrate type
	(3) wire width
	(4) shield wiire width
	(5) spacing from wire center to shield wire center
	(6) capacitance from wire to substrate
	(7) capacitance between wire and shield wire

Work below:
-------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Parallel plate cap:
    Note:  Tables don't differentiate between diffusion and mv-diffusion,
	   although the metal stackup description indicates a height
	   difference.  Presumably the height difference is the gate
	   oxide thickness difference; e.g., the poly sits at the same
	   height everywhere but the diffusion height determines the
	   difference between field oxide, low voltage diffusion thin
	   oxide, and high (medium) voltage diffusion thick oxide.
	   Tables are assumed to refer to thin oxide diffusion height.

	   There is no height difference between substrate and nwell,
	   so there are only two columns below.
	   
		sub,nw	diff
	poly	106.13	N/A
	li	 36.99	55.3	
	met1	 25.78	33.6
	met2	 17.5	20.8
	met3	 12.37	14.2
	met4	  8.42	 9.41
	met5	  6.32	 6.88

	The numbers above were lifted from magic's tech file but can
	be found (at lower precision) in:

	/home/tim/gitsrc/open_pdks/sources/sky130-pdk/libraries/sky130_fd_pr/\
		latest/models/parameters/typical.spice

	where, e.g., poly-to-sub is "mcp1f_ca_*", li-to-diff is "mcl1d_ca_*",
	etc. ("f" indicates field oxide, and "d" indicates diffusion).

    To get values for mv-diffusion:
	Back-calculate difference according to the (1/d) difference in
	diffusion height.

    Sanity check:  diff    @ 0.3230um
		   mv-diff @ 0.3152um
		   --------------------
			     0.0078um  (78 Angstroms)

    Document ~/gits/skywater-src-nda/docs-src/S8\ Design\ Manual\ revC\ draft.pdf
	says Gate oxide (equivalent) thicknesses area 32 Angstroms (thin oxide)
	and 110 Angstroms (thick oxide)---Difference is 78 Angstroms, so this
	all checks out!

	(FYI, SPICE model of nfet_01v8 has 4.15nm tox, not 3.2nm, and)
	pfet_01v8 has 4.23nm;  nfet_03v3 has 11.6nm, and pfet_03v3 has 11.75nm.
	These are "effective" thickness.)

    Therefore, assuming that the dielectric for this calculation is dominated
	by the K=3.9 FOX and PSG,

		C = K(e0)/d

	Check li on field:	C = 3.9(8.854)/(0.9361 - 0.3230) = 56.32
	(slightly off, but close)
				C = 3.9(8.854)/(0.9361 - 0.3152) = 55.61
	(correcting for the K value, inserting the table value of 55.3
	 into the first equation yields K = 3.8293:
		55.3 * (0.9361 - 0.3230) / 8.854 = 3.8293
	 then plug this into the 2nd equation:
				C = 3.8293(8.854)/(0.9361 - 0.3152) = 54.61

	(Show your work!)
        -------------------------------------------------------------
	li:  	55.3 * (0.9361 - 0.3230) / 8.854 = 3.8293
		3.8293 * 8.854 / (0.9361 - 0.3152) =  54.61
	met1:	33.6 * (1.3761 - 0.3230) / 8.854 = 3.9964
		3.9962 * 8.854 / (1.3761 - 0.3152) =  33.35
	met2:	20.8 * (2.0061 - 0.3230) / 8.854 = 3.9540
		3.9540 * 8.854 / (2.0061 - 0.3152) =  20.7
	met3:	14.2 * (2.7861 - 0.3230) / 8.854 = 3.9503
		3.9503 * 8.854 / (2.7861 - 0.3152) = 14.16
	met4:	9.41 * (4.0211 - 0.3230) / 8.854 = 3.9303
		3.9303 * 8.854 / (4.0211 - 0.3152) = 9.39
	met5:	6.88 * (5.3711 - 0.3230) / 8.854 = 3.9226
		3.9226 * 8.854 / (5.3711 - 0.3152) = 6.87
        -------------------------------------------------------------
	(For the heck of it, add in the gate cap)
	poly:   C = 3.9 * 8.854 / (0.3262 - 0.3230) = 10791
		C = 3.9 * 8.854 / (0.3262 - 0.3152) = 3139.1
	 
	New table of values:

		sub,nw	lv-diff	mv-diff
	poly	106.13	N/A	N/A
	li	 36.99	55.3	54.6
	met1	 25.78	33.6	33.4
	met2	 17.5	20.8	20.7
	met3	 12.37	14.2	14.2
	met4	  8.42	 9.41	 9.39
	met5	  6.32	 6.88	 6.87

   It seems like a better idea to just calculate these.

	If you assume that the fringe capacitance is constant as wire width increases,
	then the parallel plate capacitance can be found from two 1-wire simulations:

	e.g. poly:  cap(total) = width*cap(area) + cap(fringe)
		    278.68aF/um = 1.5um*cap(area) + cap(fringe)
		    89.97aF/um = 0.15um*cap(area) + cap(fringe)
		    ------------------------------------------
		    188.71aF/um = 1.35*cap(area)
		    cap(area) = 139.79aF/um	 (not a very good estimate)

	vs. direct calculation:
		    cap(area) = 8.854 * 3.9 / 0.3262 = 105.86
	The number is exact if the K=3.9 is assumed to be rounded;  a value K=3.91
	yields an exact answer.  Finding the effective K for an entire dielectric stack
	is 1/C_eff = 1/C_1 + 1/C_2 + 1/C_3 + ...
	Where each C_i is calculated for the given thickness of the dielectric.

	Created script "calc_parallel.py" which generates these values for each
	metal stackup (values between each metal and each ground plane conductor).
	Given that all other values being calculated here are based solely on
	geometric considerations and not vendor tables, it makes more sense to use
	these numbers even though they are slightly off from the table values.

   Values used below are all from output file "areacap_results.txt" from the
   calculated expression (using calc_parallel.py).

-------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Single wire values:
	1st result:
		poly subs 0.1500 1.0663e-10
	vs. 2-wire
		poly subs 0.1500 0.2100 7.9059e-11 4.5335e-11
	or
		poly subs 0.1500 2.1000 1.0421e-10 2.5354e-12

	That is, 1.0663e-10 total cap to substrate (plate + fringe), no shielding
		 7.9059e-11 with near-body shielding at 0.21um separation
		 1.0421e-10 with near-body shielding at 2.10um separation.

	subtract baseline parallel plate cap,  poly = 105.86 (aF/um^2) * 0.15um = 15.88 aF/um
	or 1.588e-11

	so:  1.0663e-10 - 1.588e-11 = 9.075e-11 for fringe on both sides, or
	4.5375e-11 maximum fringe on one side, or 45.38 aF/um
	(compare to value 55.27 in magic tech file)

        -------------
	Try again with metal3:

	1st result:
		m3 subs 3.0000 1.1964e-10
	vs. 2-wire
		m3 subs 3.0000 0.3000 8.4366e-11 1.7206e-10
	or
		m3 subs 3.0000 3.0000 9.8699e-11 3.092e-11

	That is, 1.1964e-10 total cap to substrate (plate + fringe), no shielding
		 8.4366e-11 with near-body shielding at 0.3um separation
		 9.8699e-11 with near-body shielding at 3.0um separation

	subtract baseline parallel plate cap, m3 = 13.29 (aF/um^2) * 3um = 39.88 aF/um
	or 3.988e-11

	(1) Take the 1-wire result (1.1964e-10), multiply by 1e12 to get aF/um = 119.64aF/um
	(2) Total fringe = 119.64aF/um - 39.88aF/um = 79.76aF/um total fringe.
	(3) Divide by two for fringe per side:  79.76aF/um / 2 = 39.88 aF/um.

	Compare to the value in magic of 40.99. . .  very close.


(2b) The above analyses can be expanded to make the 'conductor' equal to each
     metal top, which yields results for inter-plate capacitance (in the
     downward direction only).

    Calculation for metal5-to-poly (0.15um wide poly) result:
	Baseline parallel plate cap = 7.5349 (aF/um^2) * 1.6um = 12.056 aF/um
	from areacap list.

	See discussion below for upward inter-plate capacitance for the
	sanity check from the matrix result.  The discussion below is for
	downward fringing.

	(1) Take the total coupling between 1.6um wide m5 and poly = 1.18e-10
	(2) Subtract off the parallel plate cap part:  1.2056e-11. Value is 1.058e-10
	    total fringe.
	(3) Divide by two for fringe per side: 5.29e-11 or 52.9 aF/um

	Compare with the value in magic (39.91 aF/um).  Pretty far off, but at least
	ballpark magnitude.  What about the wider m5 result:

	(1) total coupling = 3.3736e-10
	(2) parallel plate 7.5349 * 16 = 120.56aF/um.  Subtract -> 2.168e-10
	(3) Divide by two:  108.4 aF/um (which is off by about a factor of 3, so
		if wire width is ignored then the result can have a huge error).

    Calculation for metal4-to-metal5 (0.3um wide metal4) result:
	Baseline parallel plate cap = 70.131 aF/um^2 * 1.6um = 112aF or 1.12e-10
	Total coupling between m5 and m4 = 2.5279e-10
	Subtract off parallel plate part = 1.406e-10
	Divide by two = 7.03e-11 or 70.3aF

	Compare with the value in magic (82.82aF).  Reasonably close.

	For the 16um wide metal 5:
	Baseline parallel plate cap = 70.131 aF/um^2 * 16um = 1122aF or 1.12e-9
	Total coupling between m5 and m4 = 1.4366e-09
	Subtract off parallel plate part = 3.145e-10
	Divide by two = 1.57e-10 or 157aF (this is a very large effect!)

(2c) The above analyses can be expanded to add a 'conductor' for the
     bottom of the metal above, yielding results for inter-plate capacitance
     in the upward direction.

	Analysis done with build_fc_files_w1n.py

    Issue:  The geometry file looks correct but the results fail to have equal
	off-diagonal values.  Why??

    Calculation for poly-to-metal5 (0.15um wide poly) result:
	Baseline parallel plate cap = 7.5349 (aF/um^2) * 0.15um = 1.13 aF/um
	from areacap list.

	Fastercap matrix:	m5	6.072e-10	-9.062e-12
				poly	-6.9017e-12	1.05901e-10

	Sanity check poly-to-substrate = 1.05901e-10 - 6.9017e-12 = 9.90e-11
	This is "reasonably" close to the 1.066e-10 value from the single
	wire result.

	sanity check m5-to-substrate = 6.072e-10 - 9.062e-12 = 5.981e-10 / 80 = 7.5e-12
		This is "reasonably" close to the 6.7854 value from the areacap list.

	So assuming that this is more or less correct. . .

	(1) Take the total coupling between m5 and poly = 6.902e-12
	(2) Subtract off the parallel plate cap part:  1.13e-13. Value is 6.79e-12
	    total fringe.
	(3) Divide by two for fringe per side: 3.395e-12 or 3.39 aF/um

	Compare with the value in magic (6.49 aF/um).  Pretty far off, but at least
	ballpark magnitude.  Using the average value give 3.93e aF/um, and using
	the larger value yields 4.47 aF/um.  Should the larger value be used?

    Calculation for metal4-to-metal5 (0.3um wide metal4) result:
	Baseline parallel plate cap = 70.131 aF/um^2 * 0.3um = 21aF or 2.104e-11
	Total coupling between m5 and m4 = 1.127e-10
	Subtract off parallel plate part = 9.17e-11
	Divide by two = 4.58e-11 or 45.8aF

	Compare with the value in magic (46.98aF).  Very close.

----------------------------------------------
    Check last result vs. wire width:
	
    Calculation for metal4-to-metal5 (3.0um wide metal4) result:
	Baseline parallel plate cap = 70.131 aF/um^2 * 3.0um = 210aF or 2.104e-10
	Total coupling between m5 and m4 = 3.0281e-10
	Subtract off parallel plate part = 9.24e-11
	Divide by two = 4.62e-11.

    Those numbers do not change much due to width, but compare against the
    metal5 results for the downward fringing field above, which differ by
    factors like three.  Need to figure out how that differs between a
    wire edge perimeter and the wire end perimeter.

    But at least all the files and calculations above are sufficient for
    generating all of the numbers in a magic tech file.

----------------------------------------------
3. Now for the analysis of partial shielding.  For near-body shielding
   of the fringe, the numbers are in w2_results.txt:

   (1) m3 to substrate:
	w1_results.txt has m3 (0.3um wide) to substrate = 7.3345e-11
	w2_results.txt has:
		3.0	5.756e-11
		2.7	5.629e-11
		2.4	5.545e-11
		2.1	5.413e-11
		1.8	5.276e-11
		1.5	5.118e-11
		1.2	4.962e-11
		0.9	4.765e-11
		0.6	4.539e-11
		0.3	4.271e-11
	Each of these is a total coupling capacitance.  From areacap_results.txt
	m3 -> subs = 13.292 aF/um^2 * 0.3um = 3.988 aF/um = 3.988e-12
	7.3345e-11 - 3.988e-12 = 6.936e-11, /2 = 3.468e-11 or 34.68 aF/um
	Parallel plate cap + open side fringe = (34.68 + 3.988 =) 3.8666e-11
	or 38.7 aF/um.  Subtract this to get the fringe capacitance on the
	single shielded side, and compare to table values:
			calculated		table
		inf	3.4634e-11		(2.82e-11 at 9um)
		3.0	1.8894e-11		1.64e-11 at 3.3um)
		2.7	1.7624e-11
		2.4	1.6784e-11
		2.1	1.5464e-11		1.18e-11
		1.8	1.4094e-11
		1.5	1.2514e-11
		1.2	1.0954e-11		7.0e-12
		0.9	8.9840e-12
		0.6	6.7240e-12		3.7e-12
		0.3	4.0440e-12		1.9e-12

	Whom do you trust?  Anyway, that's how the calculation is done.
	Also probably useful to check if the sidewall capacitance is
	equal to the loss of fringe capacitance.

	e.g., m3 @ 0.3um width, 1.2um separation:
	Fringe cap dropped from 3.4634e-11 to 1.0954e-11, or 2.37e-11
	Coupling capacitance is 4.90e-11.  Half of that is 2.45e-11.
	So yes, probably the simpler method is to just take the total
	fringe and subtract off half the coupling.  Saves the trouble
	of modeling the near-body effect (or rather, the near-body
	effect is just the coupling capacitance).
	
	Well, that was easy!

4. Now, for the more difficult task of determining the amount of
   partial fringe coupling onto a wire.

	build_fc_files_w1sh.py  -->
		fastercap_files/w1sh/<m1>_<m2>_w_<width>_ss_<sep>.lst

	There are convergence problems centered around
		fastercap_files/w1sh/poly_m5_w_0p15_ss_n1p05.lst
	These are all specific to m5 and probably indicate something
	wrong.
	Yes:  The Y value is wrong (seen this before, I think---due
	to checking "metal" and not "conductor").  Okay, needed to
	use "sbase" and not "wbase" for "conductor".

   Now how to interpret results?  Is this even a reasonable test?
   For most of the data, there are downward fringing fields on one
   side, overlap capacitance in the middle, and upward fringing
   fields on the other side.

   Here are some results. . .  metal3 0.3um wide under a
   metal4 shield (see w1sh_test.py):
   (1) Areacap only:  m3 to subs = 13.292 aF/um (* 0.3um = 3.99 aF/um)
   (2) Areacap only:  m3 to m4 = 93.081 aF/um (* 0.3um = 27.92 aF/um)
   (3) Total upward cap m3 (0.3um width) to m4 (plane) = 125.83 aF/um
   (4) Total downward cap m3 (0.3um width) to substrate = 73.35 aF/um

   In the shield test: (3) shows up clearly when the m4 shield
   completely covers the m3.  (4) shows up clearly when the shield is
   completely absent.  Plot of m3 to m4 coupling looks like it can be
   well modeled.  But m3 to substrate when completely covered by the
   shield is 29.0 aF/um.  If one assumes that the parallel plate cap
   (3.99 aF/um) is unaffected, then the shield has "stolen" fringe
   cap from the substrate:

	Total fringe m3 to subs (w/o shield) = 73.35 - 3.99 = 69.36 aF/um (34.68 per side)
	Total fringe m3 to subs (with shield) = 29 - 3.99 = 25 aF/um (12.5 per side)
				  Difference = 44.35 (22.18 per side)
	Total fringe m3 to m4 = 125.83 - 27.92 = 97.91 aF/um (48.96 per side)
	(manual test---take w1n result above and remove the substrate)
	Total fringe m3 to m4 (no subs) = 153.78 - 27.92 = 125.86 aF/um (62.93 per side)

   Note that upward fringe is modeled with the substrate in place, so
   any fringe pulled away to the substrate has already been accounted
   for in that number.

   Possible models of fringe splitting:
   Ratio of m3-m4 vs. m3-subs = 0.39um vs. 2.79um
		1/0.39 = 2.56,  1/2.79 = 0.36.   0.36 / 2.56 = 14%
   Ratio of m3(midpoint)-m4 vs. m3(midpoint)-subs = 0.81um vs. 3.21um
		1/0.81 = 1.23,  1/3.21 = 0.31.   0.31 / 1.23 = 25%
   Ratio of m3(bottom)-m4 vs. m3(top)-subs = 1.23um vs. 3.64um
		1/1.23 = 0.81,  1/3.64=0.27.  0.27 / 0.81 = 33%

   But 12.5 (shielded fringe) / 34.68 (unshielded fringe) = 36%
       48.96 (shielded fringe) / 62.93 (unshielded fringe) = 78%

   It appears not to be deducible, and therefore probably needs to be
   an additional parameter to the parasitic model.  But keep investigating.
   Maybe there's a simple way to derive the split of the fringe cap between
   two metals in opposite directions.

--------------------------------------------
Proceeding to run a 2nd detailed test using w1sh with a shield type
underneath, so that the existing model of fringe distribution can be
validated.

First, updating all of the scripts to allow each one to take options
to control the layer types used and the start/stop/step values for
taking data. (Done)

-------------------------------------------
Now:  For m3 over m2,  m3 wire width = 1um.
    build_fc_files_w1.py metal_stack_sky130A.py -metals=m3 -conductors=m2 \
		-width=1,2,1 -verbose=1 -tolerance=0.001
    C = 217.75 aF/um --- This gives the single result for an "infinite" m2 shield.

    build_fc_files_w1sh.py metal_stack_sky130A.py -metals=m3 -shields=m2 \
		-width=1,2,1 -sep=-20,20,0.1 -verbose=1 -tolerance=0.004

    Currently no script to load the result into octave, so need to edit the
    output file and convert "m3 m2" into "3 2".  Then load into octave and,
    e.g.,
		plot(w1sh_results(:,4), w1sh_results(:,7))

    which gives the coupling as the m2 shield underneath is pulled back
    (-20 is full shielding;  +20 is 19.5um to the left, with the wire
    fully exposed.)

    Areacap results:  m3->m2 is 88.54 aF/um^2 so 88.54 aF/um for the 1um wire.
    If total cap for full shield is 217.75, then single-side fringe is
    64.6 aF/um.

    When the shield is fully underneath the wire but does not extend outward
    (sep = -0.5), a naive estimate of coupling is plate + one side fringe =
    88.54 + 64.6 = 153.14 aF/um.

    The actual FasterCap result at sep = -0.5 is 174.0 aF/um which is not
    too bad (12% off, due to the fact that additional coupling occurs
    between the vertically aligned sidewalls).  The 153.14 aF/um value is
    crossed at about sep=-0.2um, or 0.3um inset from the wire edge.

    Plotting from sep=-0.5um to sep=-8um gives the relationship for the
    total amount of fringe.  Subtract off the baseline of 153.14 aF/um
    from the Y value, and subtract 0.5 from the X value and negate it;
    then divide the Y value by 64.6 aF/um to get the fraction of the
    fringe cap.  Then divide the X value by 8 (used as the halo in the
    current tech file for magic).  Plot vs. sin((pi/2) * X / 8), and
    it's clear that this is a very bad model. . .

    The fringe coupling is perfectly modeled by an arctangent:

	C_fringe fraction = (2/pi) * atan((x + 0.35) * 1.45)

    where the 0.35 corresponds to the amount of underlap at which no
    fringe is coupling*, and 1.45 is a coefficient that needs to be
    determined from data (can it be related to the magnitude of the
    fringe?).---Needs calculating for all layers to find any trends.
    Also needs to consider the wire width.

    *As an added complication, once there's an underlap, then the
     area cap is getting reduced.  In the above case, the area cap
     is 88.54 aF/um for the entire 1um wire, so at 0.35um underlap,
     there's only 57.55 aF/um.

     In other words, subtracting 153.14 for the rest of the cap is
     only valid to x=-0.5.  Above that, for every delta x = 0.1um,
     the amount to subtract gets lower by 8.854 aF/um.

     e.g., at x=-0.5, total cap is 174.03, subtract 153.14, fringe is 20.89
           at x=-0.4, total cap is 169.04, subtract 144.29, fringe is 24.75 
           at x=-0.3, total cap is 163.11, subtract 135.43, fringe is 27.68
           at x=-0.2, total cap is 156.46, subtract 126.58, fringe is 29.88
           at x=-0.1, total cap is 148.49, subtract 117.72, fringe is 30.77
	   ...
           at x=+0.1, total cap is 103.87, subtract  64.60, fringe is 39.27

     And this is increasing because it is now counting the upward fringe
     cap of the shield onto the bottom of the wire, which also has some
     residual at an underlap.  The superposition of all these effects
     makes the analysis rather complicated.

     Will take more data and revisit.  Cannot rework the model in magic
     until there is a way to derive the coefficients, or a place to put
     them in the tech file.
    
-------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, want to pin down whether the calculation for near-body fringe
shielding can be replaced by simply subtracting the sidewall capacitance
from the fringe.  (Then:  Can something similar be done to account for
the amount of downward fringe lost to a shield above a wire?)

    w1: poly 0.15 to subs = 106.63 aF/um
    w2: 0.21 sep:  79.06 + 45.33 = 124.39
	0.42 sep:  83.18 + 25.62 = 108.80
	0.63 sep:  90.65 + 16.11 = 106.76
	0.84 sep:  96.38 + 11.59 = 107.97
	1.05 sep:  99.12 +  8.48 = 107.60
	1.26 sep: 100.81 +  6.39 = 107.20

    w1: m3 0.3 to subs = 73.345 aF/um
    w2: 0.30 sep:  42.71 + 143.83 = 186.54
	0.60 sep:  45.39 +  84.85 = 130.24
	0.90 sep:  47.65 +  61.34 = 108.99
	1.20 sep:  49.62 +  48.96 = 98.58
	2.10 sep:  54.13 +  30.68 = 84.81
	3.00 sep:  57.56 +  21.83 = 79.39

    Both diverge at close spacing

	Magic's tech file has sidewall = 74 aF/um with 0.4um offset for m3
					 16 aF/um with no offset for poly.

    Magic's values are adjusted for wide wires and indicate a rather
    high error for narrow wires.  Regardless, this doesn't appear to
    justify determing fringe shielding by subtracting off sidewall.
  
    Redo the m3 table above for single-side fringe:

    w1: m3 0.3 to subs = 38.666 aF/um
    w2: 0.30 sep:  4.04 (+ 143.83)
        0.60 sep:  6.72 (+  84.85)
        0.90 sep:  8.98 (+  61.34)
        1.20 sep: 10.95 (+  48.96)
        2.10 sep: 15.46 (+  30.68)
        3.00 sep: 18.89 (+  21.83) (meaningless relationship?)

    Get detailed data for one case. . .

	build_fc_files_w2.py metal_stack_sky130A.py -metals=m3 -sub=subs \
		-width=1,2,2 -sep=0.3,15,0.1 -tol=0.004 -file=test.txt

    m3 areacap to subs = 13.292 aF/um^2 (@ 1um width = 13.292 aF/um)
    maximum total cap from wire to subs ~= 86.0 aF/um
    1 side fringe = (86.0 - 13.292)/2 = 36.354
    plate + 1 side fringe = 13.292 + 36.354 = 49.646 aF/um

    This almost exactly follows the relationship

	C_fringe = C_fringe(max) * tanh((sep + 0.5)/6.0)

    Again, there are two coefficients controlling this.  The offset
    might be equal to the offset needed to get the 1/sep relationship
    to work for sidewall coupling (it's in a very similar range).

Now it is time to take large amounts of data and get coefficients
for these equations, then see how these coefficients change for
different wire widths, since all calculations in magic currently are
assuming that the values *don't* change with wire width, which is
definitely wrong, but it is unknown to what degree it's wrong.

Then, finally, try to get a set of equations that correctly compute
capacitance within a reasonable error bound for all geometries, and
determine the least number of coefficients needed to capture all
equations.  If wire width is necessary to be known for all
calculations, then figure out how to do this efficiently in magic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary so far:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic equations (without adjustments for wire width):

1.  Parallel plate capacitance (aF/um^2) = A
2.  Sidewall capacitance (aF/um) = B / (sep + C)
3.  Total fringe capacitance (aF/um) = D
4.  Fringe capacitance with near-body shielding = D * tanh(E * (sep + F))
5.  Partial fringe capacitance = D * (2/pi) * atan(G * (x + H))

How to find:

A:    Direct calculation (calc_parallel.py) (results/areacap_results.txt)
B, C: Use build_fc_files_w2.py (results/w2_results.txt).  For a given wire
      width (result file 3rd column), get coupling cap (6th column) vs.
      separation (4th column) and do a curve fit to  B / (sep + C).
D:    Use build_fc_files_w1.py (results/w1_results.txt).  For a given wire
      width (result file 3rd column), total cap is value in 4th column.
      Subtract (A * wire width) and divide the result by 2 to get D (total
      fringe capacitance per unit length on a single edge).
E, F: Use build_fc_files_w2.py (results/w2_results.txt).  For a given wire
      width (result file 3rd column), get total fringe (5th column) vs.
      separation.  Subtract ((A * wire width) + D) to get the fringe cap
      on the shielded side only.  Curve fit to D * tanh(E * (sep + F)).
G, H: Use build_fc_files_w1sh.py (results/w1sh_results.txt).  For a given
      wire width (result file 3rd column), get coupling cap (7th column)
      vs. shield edge separation (4th column).  Take -(x + 1/2 wire width)
      to get shield distance from wire edge, and compute coupling cap
      minus ((A * wire width) + D) to get amount of fringe coupling to the
      shield.  Then curve fit to D * (2/pi) * atan(G * (x + H)).

Remaining effects to work in:
(1) Changes in coefficients above vs. wire width.  Which ones vary most
    with wire width?
(2) Sidewall coupling for all metal combinations other than same-metal
    (including exactly-overlapping or underlapping sidewalls)
(3) Changes in sidewall coupling with shields (above and below)
(4) Changes in fringe capacitance with shielding above
(5) Capacitance to a wire on the other side of a same-plane shield

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Script "compute_coefficients.py" generates all the parallel plate
and fringe capacitance coefficients (A and D above).

Need to investigate why fringing from metal 5 is so large.  Based on
SkyWater tables and the back-of-the envelope calculation of 1.5 the
upward fringe from metal 4 to metal 5, the m5->m4 fringe should be about 
83 aF/um.  Instead it is 125, which is 50% too high.  The area cap is
70.13 aF/um^2, so for a 1.6um wire, the parallel plate cap should be
112.2 aF/um, so I would expect a total capacitance of 112.2 + 2 * 83 =
278.  Instead I'm getting 375.

Changing air to a K=6 dielectric, the capacitance drops to around what
is expected.  So the difference is in the lack of polyimide on top!
I have been ignoring the fact that the TOPOX is not handled correctly,
so need to see if that has any significant impact (difference is that
it goes from 375 to 362, so compared to 278, not a large error, although
it should be fixed in the code).

Ugh. . . But that means that there are different coefficients for metal 5
depending on whether the chip is bump bonded or not.  Micross polyimide is
a K=3.3 dielectric.  With air replaced by a 3.3 dielectric, the total
capacitance is 285.

(Leave that for now. . . Will probably want a variant in the extraction
deck for magic to account for it.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Use least mean squares curve fitting in python (numpy). . .  No
particular need to invoke octave for this.
